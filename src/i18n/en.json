  "sistemasp1": "For the exhibition Sistemas e Processos, Andrés Stephanou presents two new works digitally constructed. In Organismo Digital (2018–2019), a custom software conceived by the artist,  operated by a custom high performance computer, simulates a mass of thousands of orchestrated particles performing randomly, In real-time, driven by random algorithms, a unique visual composition is generated at each instant of time, with no compositional repetition. The instant of visual composition generated by the software in the present does not recur in the future. Organismo Digital replicates the infinite variability and constant alterability seen in processes and patterns of nature, in a visually subjective context. Organismo Digital introduces a temporal, material, and spatial perception.",
  "sistemasp2": "At 1 minuto (2018), a thin line of light incorporeal and impalpable for the viewer, projected in a wall in the exhibition space, performs a complete spinning process in sixty seconds, under clockwise motion. In a contemplative experience, 1 minuto proposes to the viewer perception and notion to the equivalence and velocity of the passage of time.",
  "particulas1": "Partículas de Luz is an exhibition featuring two visualization versions of visual matter generated by a custom software conceived by Andrés Stephanou. Generative, the software simulates thousands of fluid moving light microparticles, constantly changing the concentration and the volume of the composition, in an uncontrollable and unpredictable process managed by random algorithms. While Partículas de Luz 1 (2017–2018) introduces a close view of the visual matter generated by the software, Partículas de Luz 2 (2017–2018) introduces a distant view, in non-simultaneous operations performed by individual custom computers. For the conception of the custom software, Andrés Stephanou takes inspiration in the constant alterability and the infinite variability present in processes seen in nature, in its broadest representational subjectivity. During one hour of the exhibition, Partículas de Luz 1 and Partículas de Luz 2 can produce, each of the works, over two hundred thousand distinct visual compositions, never repetitive, being able to generate more than five million distinct versions if arranged during the uninterrupted 24-hour period. The visual composition generated by the software in the present instant will not recur in the future, replicating the capacity of never compositional repetition seen in nature's patterns.",
  "particulas2": "Not presented by Andrés Stephanou in the exhibition, there are two works that introduce to other visualization versions of the visual matter generated by the custom software. In Partículas de Luz 3 (2017–2018) a high zoom view of the visual matter generated by the software is introduced, while in Partículas de Luz (VR) (2017–2018) the visualization of the visual matter generated by the software is presented in virtual reality for free exploration to the viewer, in an immersive experience.",
  "micro1": "In Micropartículas, a single work with a homonymous title of the exhibition is presented by Andrés Stephanou. Micropartículas (2016–2017) is a simulation generated by a custom software conceived by the artist and operated by a custom high performance computer. Micropartículas synthesize, in a concise and subjective language, Andrés Stephanou’s research. The artist explores the possibility of works possessing the capacity for infinite reconfiguration, replicating the compositional alterability and variability of processes and patterns seen in nature. Under the own-gravitational influence, thousands of microparticles are managed in real-time by random algorithms, in an endless and unpredictable rearrangement process."
